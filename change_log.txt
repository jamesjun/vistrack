  distance to food (m)
  Heading angle error (0..90 deg)
  Proximity to each shape (boolean, controlled by "dist_cm_shapes" in defatul.cfg).
New features in "Input Coordinates" tool
  Counterclockwise rotation is added to the mouse right-click menu.
  Enhanced image contrast.
  Plot trajectory key is added (press "T" to toggle on/off).

[v0.3.0, 8/2/2018]

Added a shortcut for "Input coordinates" figure: "[E]xport CSV" to export individual trial.

[v0.2.9, 8/1/2018]
Trialset "Export to CSV" exports trajectories and shape locations in the grid frame of reference.
  Rotation and scale factor are corrected and saved in metric and degree units.
  (0,0) position corresponds to the center of the aquarium where (x,y) axis intersects.
  Angle is measured from the x-axis in counterclockwise orientation.
  Trajectory files are saved to "_Track.csv" and shape locations are saved to "_shapes.csv" file.

[v0.2.8, 7/31/2018]
Bugfix: "Input Coordinates" oversize issue is corrected.
