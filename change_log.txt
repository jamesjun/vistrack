  - Columns: "Sampling density (counts/m)", "Sampling rate (Hz)", "Speed (m/s)", "Escan density (counts/m)", "Visit count", "Visit duration (s)", "Duration per visit", "Freq. backward swimming",

  Pressing "S" plots sampling density bar plots for the individual trial.
"Export CSV" button
  Added velocity (signed) and distance/escan columns at the end
"default.cfg"
  Added distance to the circular wall from the center ("diameter_cm_wall")
    and exclusion distance ("dist_cm_wall") parameters

[v0.3.4, 8/12/2018]
"Export to CSV (all)" and "Expport to CSV"
  A_E (error angle: food vec-heading vec) now ranges from -90..90 deg (previously 0..90 deg)
Bugfix: "Input coordinates"
  [D]ensity keyboard shortcut added: plots the sampling density plot. 
  [G]oto trial command now accepts a full file path as well as the trial ID.
  Grid markers changed from '+' to '.' to permit right-clicking near the grid markers.
  Closing the figure prompts the file saving dialog. Previously user had to press "OK" on the message box to save.

  Mouse click on the pixel now correctly copies the probe trial file location.
"Check sync" button
  "Shift" left/right jumps by 10 video frames and "Control" left/rigth jumps by 100 frames.

[v0.3.3, 8/10/2018]
"Check Sync" button
  "Page Up/Down" button steps through the event markers.
"Check Sync (all)" button 
  Clicking the iamge cell displays the location of file and copies to the clipboard.
"Sync timing" button
  It applies the new time sync methods by using all the LED pulses (intead of using the first and last only).
"Initialize" button
  Faster video loading using the cached uncompressed video (_mov000x000.bin)
"Import _Track" button
  Copies _Track.mat files from one folder to each individual folder where the video file is located.
"Export to CSV (all)" button
  Data is resampled at 100 Hz after applying ADC-Camera time synchronization
    (previously sampled at each camera frame capture time)

[v0.3.2, 8/7/2018]
"Fix Sync" button 
  Manual time sync validation tool is added.
  Outputs uncompressed movie preview (_mov000x000.bin) for faster subsequent loading.
Trialset "Fix sync" button
  Automatically corrects all sync errors in the trialset.
Bugfix: "List files" button

[v0.3.1, 8/6/2018]
"CSV export" feature now includes "_relations.csv" file that exports following info
  Frame capture time (s)
  distance to food (m)

  Proximity to each shape (boolean, controlled by "dist_cm_shapes" in defatul.cfg).
New features in "Input Coordinates" tool
  Counterclockwise rotation is added to the mouse right-click menu.
  Enhanced image contrast.
  Plot trajectory key is added (press "T" to toggle on/off).

[v0.3.0, 8/2/2018]

Added a shortcut for "Input coordinates" figure: "[E]xport CSV" to export individual trial.

[v0.2.9, 8/1/2018]
Trialset "Export to CSV" exports trajectories and shape locations in the grid frame of reference.
  Rotation and scale factor are corrected and saved in metric and degree units.
  (0,0) position corresponds to the center of the aquarium where (x,y) axis intersects.
  Angle is measured from the x-axis in counterclockwise orientation.
  Trajectory files are saved to "_Track.csv" and shape locations are saved to "_shapes.csv" file.
